 DVRouter Specification

Write a DVRouter class which inherits from the Entity class. The function that you will need to override
is handle_rx dealing with the following three types of packets (feel free to add more member functions to
DVRouter).

• DiscoveryPackets are received by either ends of a link when either the link goes up or the link goes
down. Your DVRouter should never send or forward DiscoveryPackets

• RoutingUpdates contain the routing information that is received from the neighbours.

• Other packets are data packets which need to be sent on an appropriate port based on switch’s current
routing table.


""" There are three types of packets: 
    	1. Discovery packets : 
    	are received by either ends of a 
    	link when either the link goes up or the link goes down. 
    	Your DVRouter should never send or forward DiscoveryPackets.

    	2. RoutingUpdates:
    	contain the routing information that is 
    	received from the neighbours.

    	3. Data packets:
    	Other packets are data packets which need to be sent on an 
    	appropriate port based on switch’s current routing table.
