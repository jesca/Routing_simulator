What challenges did you face in implementing your router? 
The challenges we faced were dealing with loops and handling router updates. It was tricky determining whether a link was broken or if it was possible to find another connection, then updating all the apprpriate nodes once the answer was found. Unforunately, we wrote a function that we tested and spent some time tweaking, and then realized it was the one thing holding us back from the correct answer!

Name a feature NOT specified in this specification that would improve your router. 
If we had knowledge of when peak hours are from certain hosts, as well as which hosts upload and download more often than others, we would be able to distribute the routing of packets more effetively.

Specify if your code can handle link weights or do incremental updates. If you have implemented any of them, describe what additional considerations need to be taken into.
We implemented our code to handle link weights by using the latency from the discovery packet to initialize the link weights, and updating the costs accordingly every time we send a routerupdate packet. When a link latency is changed (say it increases), the packet will be sent through the least cost alternative route.
