2. What challenges did you face in implementing your router?
	The challenges we faced were dealing with loops and handling router updates.
3. Name a feature NOT specified in this specification that would improve your router.
	If a link drops and there is an alternative way to reach the path via an immediate neighbor, take the path.
4. Specify if your code can handle link weights or do incremental updates. If you have implemented any of them, describe what additional considerations need to be taken into.
